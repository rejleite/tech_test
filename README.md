# Tech Test WebAPI

I have created a WebAPI using Node.js with: Express, Mongoose (ORM), Express-Validator, BodyParser.
As I have done a previous course build Restfull api using Node.js and MongoDb, I decided to follow what I learnt seeing that I don't have a previous experience with that.
During the API part of the course, everything was written in server.js file. As I wasn't confortable with that aproach, I did some research on how to separate the logic. 


To use this API you have to install Node.js and MongoDb
Download the code and uses the command "npm install --save" to install all the required modules.
